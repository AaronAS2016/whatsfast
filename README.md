Send WhatsApp message without save the contact

You can try it [here](https://send-wsp-without-save.firebaseapp.com/)!


## How It Works? 🧐

Just put the phone number that you want to send a message and click the button, this will redirect to the Whatsapp app with the chat open, is that simple!

## Why? 🤔

Sometimes you have to send a message to a phone number and Whatsapp doesn't have you if you don't add a new contact. So I made this simple Web App to solve the problem.

# Development
